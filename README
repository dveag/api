# API

## Installation

The api runs in docker. It's necessary to have docker and docker-compose.

## Usage

```
docker-compose -d up
```

You can check the endpoints here:

`http://localhost/docs`

I recommend create a superuser to enter to the admin site.

You can run the next command for that:

`docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser`
